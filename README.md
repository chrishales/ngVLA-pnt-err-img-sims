ngVLA pointing error imaging simulations
=======

Scripts used to obtain the results presented in [ngVLA Memo 75](https://library.nrao.edu/public/memos/ngvla/NGVLA_75.pdf).

The scripts simulate interferometric observations in the presence of antenna pointing errors, with application to the ngVLA's Short Baseline Array (SBA) and Main Array (MA).

Requires: Python 3.6 and [CASA 6.0](https://casa.nrao.edu/casadocs/casa-5.6.0/introduction/casa6-installation-and-usage)

If you find this code useful, for example to develop more advanced simulations or perhaps as a teaching aid, please consider [forking](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking) so that others in the community can easily trace your interesting applications. (There is no need to submit any pull requests. I intend for this project to remain as a static reference alongside the memo.)
